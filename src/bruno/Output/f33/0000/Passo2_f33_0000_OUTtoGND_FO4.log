*** 5 WARNING MESSAGES GENERATED DURING SETUP

Warning : Linear system singularity was detected for node Xdut.v1>>current
Warning : Linear system singularity was detected for node Xdut.v1>>current
Fatal Error : Transient simulation failed: time step too small
            : Final time = 2.015e-009, failed timestep = 1e-018
            : The Newton solver did not converge in 10 iterations
            : You may be able to correct this problem if you:
            : 	- increase the value of the numnt option (maximum number of Newton solver iterations)
            : 	- increase the value of the reltol (aka reli) option (0.0005)
            : 	- increase the value of the abstol (aka absi) option (1e-010)
            : 	- ensure that transistor parasitics are in place, to smooth out discontinuities
            : 	- increase the rise and fall times of piecewise linear and pulse sources
            : 	- reduce the timestep, or switch to method=BDF, if there are wild voltage oscillations
